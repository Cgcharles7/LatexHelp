JavaScript Tools
This repository includes a collection of JavaScript-based tools called, designed to streamline the management, navigation and production of LaTeX documents. These tools are not to replace the LaTeX to PDF compilers. Instead, they are meant to provide quicker ways to access parts of documents that are not generally all accessible all together - like all definitions. 

paperhelp.htm
The paperhelp.htm file takes a full LaTeX source document as input and has the option to outputs what is defined as a "section" (e.g., lemmas, definitions, examples, descriptions) into a dropdown menu. This makes it easier to scroll through different sections without having to navigate through the entire document manually.

Features
Automatic Parsing: Parses the LaTeX document and identifies segments such as lemmas, definitions, examples, and descriptions.
Dropdown Navigation: Presents each segment in a dropdown menu, allowing you to quickly navigate between sections.
User-Friendly Interface: Simplifies browsing long documents by focusing on key components.
Usage Instructions
Open paperhelp.htm in a Web Browser: Simply open the file in any modern web browser.
Input LaTeX Source: Paste your LaTeX source code into the provided input field.
Navigate Through Sections: Use the dropdown menu to select and view different parts of the document.
File Structure and Dependencies
If paperhelp.htm relies on any additional scripts or libraries, include a list here with brief descriptions. For example:

CSS File (optional): If there’s custom styling, describe it briefly here.
Future Improvements
If you’re planning to expand or refine the tool, you can include ideas here for future development, such as:

Adding more LaTeX environments for parsing
Custom styling options
Search functionality within the dropdowns
